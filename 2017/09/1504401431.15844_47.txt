We ate dinner here on a Friday night. For a small town, this place was pretty busy. We were also a party of about 20-25 (all in town for a funeral), so I'm... Once again dinner was fabulous!! Best steak ever. Great wine list and ambience just add icing to the great menu which always includes regional specials.... My wife and I dined at Legends,I reviewed the ratings on Yelp also on Google before we decided to dine there and I was not disappointed with the service and... It is not only Europe and Asia that have famous regional cuisines. The United States, too, has regional cuisines. In some cases, \"Ya gotta have been there.\"... Lots of good food, reasonable prices, good service and great specials. The 99 cents margaritas seem sweet without much tequila, but try to drink two and... 4.5 Stars....They have downsized their menu a bit since opening up (likely to help cut rising food costs), but, the food on it is still very good.  4.5... The food here is actually really great. I had a steak that was mouthwatering. My boyfriend had a burger that must've been amazing because it was gone before... A MUST if you are anywhere near this area in Kansas. I could not help myself at this place. The ultimate in American COmfort Food. I truly ate like an... Everything good about this place like Playa Azul, but it is more expensive. So I had to four star it compared to five for Azul. Ohhh, My God!!!

I can't believe that I have been missing out on this place for the past few years.  I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep it to... We have been coming here for 40 years. Hasn't changed too much. The steaks are always good. Even though the salad bar is small, the blue cheese dressing has... Wasn't expecting such great food from what looked like a hole in the wall type restaurant! Its not your fancy smancy kind of restaurant so note my ratings... I have not experienced as close to a perfect value meal before going to Cirino's. I am from an east coast town with lots of fresh seafood, but the calamari... WOW! This place is a must when you're in the area! Service was impeccable, and though not cheap, the prices are great!....We started our meal with a shared... Went skiing all day and drank margaritas all night. This place is a little ratty, but what do you expect for a former brothel. You wouldn't want any... Really good fresh food. Love their bread and heard they will be getting a new location by natural selection and hopefully be making authentic Italian pizza....f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
