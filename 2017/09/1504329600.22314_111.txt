The estimated 35min wait turned into 50 but hey not bad for a Saturday evening!  We were able to grab a quick seat at the bar have a drink, app and enjoy... Stayed in Vicksburg for a week and we went here one night. Wish we would have went every night because the food was outstanding! Had the 3 way seafood combo... Wonderful food and atmosphere! Everything was outstanding. The asparagus bisque is a must, along with the shrimp tortellini. Not a place to miss if you come... Great fried chicken: piping hot, not greasy, more than I could eat.  Husband had shrimp \u0026 grits that he also liked.  Little rolls were divine.  Service... absolutely amazing! everything was great ....also the waitress, haley, was super nice. i think i have a crush :p....seriously though, was very good! cozy house turned restaurant with awesome sandwich and vegetarian selection, neat decor (rows of beer taps line one wall), good beer selection, and overf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
