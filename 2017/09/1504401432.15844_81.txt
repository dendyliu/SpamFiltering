<h3 align="center">Will NBC Cancel Wheel of Fortune After 35 Years?</h3>

<!-- Plain Text Content  -->
     <p><span style=" font-size:12pt;"><b>(Us Weekly News)</b> ??? Vanna White has struggled with weight all her life. Two years ago Wheel of Fortune told her to "Shape Up or Get Out". She either needed to drop 15pounds or find a new TV Show. </p>
      <p style="font-size:12pt;">White, who wore a size 10 then, needed a quick, consistent fix to shed pounds to keep her job. After stuggling with her body image issues her entire life she had tried Atkins, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and a slew of other programs without any success, she fell into depression and her marriage almost fell apart. She couldn't risk undergoing surgery and didn't know what to do next. The pressure to get her stunning figure back was unbareable.</p>
