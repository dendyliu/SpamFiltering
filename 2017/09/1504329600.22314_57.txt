       <li>Eye Floaters are deposits of various sizes and shapes that float within the eye.
       <li>They are caused by degenerative changes of the clear gel that fills the eyeball.
       <li>A sudden increase in floaters can be one of the first signs of retinal detachment or other severe eye conditions.
       <li>As one gets older, the number of eye floaters tends to increase. But even very young people can develop eye floaters.

<p style="font-size:14px;" align="left">This is because not only are these procedures ridiculously expensive, they are also prone to a high rate of complications.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;" align="left">Discouraged by the options, I started researching medical journals on the anatomy of the eye and why eye floaters occur.
