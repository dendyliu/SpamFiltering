<h3 align="center">Will NBC Cancel Wheel of Fortune After 35 Years?</h3>

<!-- Plain Text Content  -->
     <p><span style=" font-size:12pt;"><b>(Us Weekly News)</b> ??? Vanna White has struggled with weight all her life. Two years ago Wheel of Fortune told her to "Shape Up or Get Out". She either needed to drop 15pounds or find a new TV Show. </p>
      <p style="font-size:12pt;">White, who wore a size 10 then, needed a quick, consistent fix to shed pounds to keep her job. After stuggling with her body image issues her entire life she had tried Atkins, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and a slew of other programs without any success, she fell into depression and her marriage almost fell apart. She couldn't risk undergoing surgery and didn't know what to do next. The pressure to get her stunning figure back was unbareable.</p>

The tenderloin was perfect:) My grandfather likes to come to this place from Golden. It's now one of two sit-down full-service restaurants there. Not sure how long both will stay open... I was surprised it was this good. We're from out of town. Just drove in \u0026 got it to go. ..Hot \u0026 sour soup had a good spice but a little lacking in the sour... Really neat restaurant! One of my favorite restaurants in the area. Food is excellent, especially their steak and ribs! I've been staying at the Travelodge for business for two weeks so far and have been very happy with the Hickory Lodge Bar \u0026 Grill.  Most of my dinners have... Very nice meal tonight at Sterling's! Sophisticated decor in a beautiful turn of the century building...Excellent service from Tammy and the Chef is... Search no more food nomadic as this place gives you the quasi-supper club throwback /slash/ out-of-way uniqueness you've needed to inspire your spontaneous... While this place is a few miles from anybody who isn't staying on the lake, it's worth the drive. Everything about it was solid and the view was amazing.... Without a doubt the best taco salad I've had.  Full of flavor and just the right amount of greens. Casey is also friendly and a pleasure.  Comforting... Best breakfast I've had in Minnesota! Very very good, tons of flavor and the waitresses are AWESOME! Every time I'm looking to go out for breakfast I go here! As Pizza Ranches go this place gets an A+.  The food is very good. The place is clean, clean, clean.  Free wifi.  The staff is friendly and sincerely... I'm very glad I took a chance and got off the beaten path to find this little gem of a place! I was passing through town on my way elsewhere and was just...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
