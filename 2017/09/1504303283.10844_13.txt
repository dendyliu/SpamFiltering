<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat?  It's true -- as much as 70% of the population in the US are now considered either overweight or obese. The first thing that most people think of is that their extra bellyfat is simply ugly, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal-fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly determined that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess bodyfat, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess bellyfat.</span></p>

My wife's favorite wings. Ask for Justine. Awesome service and personality. Tony's Torture sauce... The food is consistently flavorful and the portions are generous. The relish tray is a unique throwback to the original TD and still one of my favorite... REALLY enjoyed!!!..My partner and I have been wanting to come here for about a year and a half now.  We first tasted their brews at an event at the Carnegie... The Northern is quickly becoming one of our favorite, go-to restaurants for dinner or late-night. We've been here quite a few times, and have left raving... When we first pulled in, we were mildly concerned as the exterior is tired...But we trusted Yelp and walked in. The service is swift and pleasant. Most... My husband and I moved here a year ago and have probably patronized the rustic 20-25 times. It's usually a great experience especially a few weeks ago when... I seriously can't say enough about this place. Great food. Amazing service. And incredible views. Drive here for a night to remember. Ny steak was to die... Norman Quacks is a pretty fun place to get dinner. Not the most enchanting place I've been to, but I'd go back. ....When we showed up for an early dinner... Got the regular burger. It was amazing without being too fancy. But if you're feeling fancy, holy cow, there's fancy stuff here too. Stuff I can't even... Heard, by word of mouth, about their all you can eat prime rib on Wednesday's. Totally worth the trip from downtown! Food was great, wish I could have ate... Broasted chicken is scrumptious. Very crispy, spice-enticed, and mouth-watering.....Humongous fungus app is one you have to try- it's as if the staff picked... Pretty hard to imagine a better restaurant. The food is from local farms, the preparation is really delicious and the restaurant itself is comfortable and...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
