NOTICE:  The Home Affordable Program Expires September 30, 2017.

Dear Homeowner bruce@untroubled.org,

As of today, you have yet to apply for a decrease in your home payment made available by the Home Affordable Act (HARP). You may qualify to save ($312) or more on your monthly home payment.

More than 3.7 million homeowners have already saved thousands with HARP.

The application period for this program ends September 30, 2107. Up until that time, the federal government will allow homeowners to apply to decrease their rate, lower their payment and save on interest.

See if you qualify before time runs out*, Only Here http://compete.mxtzep.bid/homerate


* Apply now to lock-in your new lower rate.
