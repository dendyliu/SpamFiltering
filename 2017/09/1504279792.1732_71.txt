     <p><span style=" font-size:16px;">Dr. Marlene Merritt (LAc, DOM(NM), MS Nutrition), a Texas-based doctor who used to suffer high blood sugar herself, made a <a href="http://fraction.vapisa.trade/cure-diabetes"><b>recent breakthrough</b></a> that is sending shockwaves through the medical community.</p>
