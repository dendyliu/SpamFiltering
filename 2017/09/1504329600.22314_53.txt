Big Ass Tenerloin is my fav. My wife likes the Western Burger. The beer is always cold too I have been to martinis many times over the last 15 years. I love the feel, the view and the food. Are usually sit alone at the bar, get a martini, some... Perfect for a get-together with a group or a go-to spot for watching the game. This place has a sports bar feel to it but not your run-of-the-mill bar... The eggplant Parmesan \u0026 tofu stir fry were awesome! The whole menu looks delicious and wait staff is friendly and attentive! Can't wait to come back! Great local pizza place. It has been recently remodeled, and I can not fault them in any one area. Food was good, service was good, definately on par with... My boys and I are in town for a basketball tourney and decided to try it this place out. It is absolutely the best Mexican food we have ever eaten!   Great... Oh, my lord, this place is absolutely amazing...The steaks fall apart in your mouth regardless of how you have them prepared.

Every time we go to Iowa, we HAVE to stop at \"the ranch!\" I know they have locations in Wisconsin and Michigan, but I wish they had some in Chicago. Maybe... Good food. Medium priced.  They have messed up my order a few times and every time they have worked to make it right. Thanks for the RAGBRAI hospitality, Shelley! Friendly staff and great food. Highly recommend the French toast and sausage.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></td>
