     <p><span style=" font-size:16px;"><b>(by Cynthia Smith, 02Sep2017)</b> - A student researcher from Stanford and a mother of 2, Heather Nelson, was able to drop 37lbs off her waist in 1 month without ever using more than 5 dollars of her own money. Heather thought it would be perfect to use grocery funds to find out how to 'hack' her weightloss. According to Heather, "the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked. But the actual solution only cost about $4."</p>

Harlie 'Quinn' made our experience very memorable...The portion sizes were much more appropriate but quite filling. The service... The mixed taco salad I had was so delicious and yummy very very filling too. My fianc\u00e9 had the devil shrimp with beans rice and she loved it's flavorful... Hands down, the best chicken kabob I've ever had, its not even close. Juicy and tender, full of flavor, and high quality chunks of chicken goodness. The... Manny P. was a fantastic server.  I was in a rush to eat before I had to leave for a flight.  Not only did Manny serve my table, but he personally manned... Went for lunch and the food was incredible. I had the chicken kebabs and from reading other yelp reviews I can only assume that they've changed the recipe.... Really good authentic food. Plenty of space for the lunch time rush during the week or even for an evening dinner....They offer a bread dish with hummus for... Based on the previous reviews I was expecting this place to be a zoo so I decided to come early. Turns out I was wrong. ....My friend and I settled in and... These guys are ridiculous.  RIDICULOUSLY good that is.  Had lunch with my better half today...We both had combo #1 which has chicken teriyaki, don katsu,... The tuna tartare was deeelish. Services was great, sat up @ the bar with Mitch. Kind of late night, they close at 10 and I got here around 845, didn't feel... I gave another try to kopepot and I really enjoy the food here. This place has a plenty of variety in their menu.....The naked burrito, sushi burrito and lamb... I was lucky to go there last week for a pre- grand opening. ....To begin with, location is great. Easy access to there, close to freeways and San Tomas...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
