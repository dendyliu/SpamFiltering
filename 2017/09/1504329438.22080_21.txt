     <p><span style=" font-size:16px;"><b>(by Cynthia Smith, 02Sep2017)</b> - A student researcher from Stanford and a mother of 2, Heather Nelson, was able to drop 37lbs off her waist in 1 month without ever using more than 5 dollars of her own money. Heather thought it would be perfect to use grocery funds to find out how to 'hack' her weightloss. According to Heather, "the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked. But the actual solution only cost about $4."</p>
