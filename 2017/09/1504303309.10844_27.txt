It has become a hobby of mine to find these little family dinners when I travel. This one didn't disappoint. Great food and value. Love the decor. Some of the best Mexican food I've had! They have different items on their menu that you don't normally see on other Mexican menus. I would highly recommend! This place is a absolute gem, what a location. It looks like a couple houses together with a very unique look inside. We got lucky and made reservations for... Lunch at the Thyme2 Pub...   Outstanding!  Burgers, salads , wood fired pizzas , sandwiches, great apps and desserts. No short cuts taken. Scratch kitchen.... Stopped in for an early dinner. The food was wonderful, gnocchi was a work of art., and the Old Fashioned was right on. Having eaten here several times the food has always been excellent. My sister and I chose to host my niece's bridal shower in their private room.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<h3 align="center">Will NBC Cancel Wheel of Fortune After 35 Years?</h3>

<!-- Plain Text Content  -->
     <p><span style=" font-size:12pt;"><b>(Us Weekly News)</b> ??? Vanna White has struggled with weight all her life. Two years ago Wheel of Fortune told her to "Shape Up or Get Out". She either needed to drop 15pounds or find a new TV Show. </p>
      <p style="font-size:12pt;">White, who wore a size 10 then, needed a quick, consistent fix to shed pounds to keep her job. After stuggling with her body image issues her entire life she had tried Atkins, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and a slew of other programs without any success, she fell into depression and her marriage almost fell apart. She couldn't risk undergoing surgery and didn't know what to do next. The pressure to get her stunning figure back was unbareable.</p>
