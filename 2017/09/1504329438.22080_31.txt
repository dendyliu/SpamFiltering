<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat?  It's true -- as much as 70% of the population in the US are now considered either overweight or obese. The first thing that most people think of is that their extra bellyfat is simply ugly, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal-fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly determined that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess bodyfat, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess bellyfat.</span></p>
