(TMZ)  Here's what Gwen Stefani told Ellen about Blake (Sheldon)'s dramatic body transformation.

"Blake is a busy guy, I mean he barely has enough time for me, so to shed 31 or so lbs in a month... I couldn't believe it!"

Gwen went on to explain what Blake was and is using to achieve his body makeover. "I did ask him about it because he got so thin so fast I was concerned he was doing something illegal. He showed me what he was taking and I was surprised. He doesn't even workout and he keeps getting in better shape."

Blake Shelton isn't the only one who is seeing the positive effects of this new slim down secret. Hollywood celebrity Khloe Kardashian shocked the world after dropping 27 lbs in just3 weeks with the new supplement. "I Couldn't believe how quickly I saw the effects.. and the fact that I could eat whatever I want when I want and still lose!" said Khloe as we spoke with her after the VMA's. Other celebrities like Melissa McCarthy and John Goodwin have used it and had incredible success.

According to a new study from researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, men and women who took the supplement for 8 weeks lost an average of 16.9 LBS, without special meals or exercise. Another study published in Nutrition Research found that people taking the extract dropped an average of 6.0 percent of their bodyweight, including 12.2 percent of their bodyfat - with zero side effects.
