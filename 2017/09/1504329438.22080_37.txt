K's is a new little country diner in Fallsville, AR. All the food is home made and the service is great. I've had the country fried steak dinner and the... I've eaten breakfast here twice and have had great meals both times.  The Catalpa Cafe is at the end of the road for sure, but worth the effort to get here.... My daughter and I were traveling from Colorado to Georgia and are glad we stopped for an excellent experience.....We saw the high school track from I-40 and... Traditional diner food done to perfection. Great value and friendly service. Gets busy at lunch time. It's also nice that many of the dinner plates come in... Stopped here looking for a decent breakfast and they did not disappoint. Clean place, yummy food, wonderful server. You want to get away from the chain... A hidden gem in Newton County. You won't find this place by accident, unless you happen to be floating the nearby Buffalo River at Steel Creek acf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

You won't find this place by accident, unless you happen to be floating the nearby Buffalo River at Steel Creek access. But... One of the best kept secrets in NW AR.  Love this place.  Cajun grilled trout is amazing.  Can't beat the views and fun to feed the trout. Torn between 3 and 4 stars. The experience was great and felt very authentic. Its hard to base the rating on food alone, so i think the atmosphere brought... When the young man on the phone said the catfish is \"amazing\", he was right. Our host told us \"it's on the house if you dont like it\", he knew we would. So... This was our first time to Borromeo's.  The pizza is loaded with cheese, and the crust is crispy.  There was a problem with the crust according to the wait... Tony and I had a nice sit down lunch in our new surroundings. We don't go to Fazoli very often, probably less than one time per year...Tony chose Iced tea... Fantastic service by Bernice. Salad bar was kept fresh and at the right temps...With everything on their salad bars you don't need a steak. Never been bad.  Food always good...Problem is the Management never schedules enough servers. 2 servers for the whole restaurant that is shameful... No... Really yummy food. If you're a marvel fan come here and eat some chicken Shawarma. ....I actually ordered the Gyro entree, a side kabob of chicken, and lamb.... The only problem with Cheddars in my opinion is that there aren't enough of them.  So whenever we find one on our route, we try to stop for lunch.... Wonderful family diner in Hillview! Service was prompt and friendly. Prices were superb value! I had Chicken Fried Chicken with collard greens and fried... Bam!!! Authentic and delicious.....Aparently Yelp likes long reviews. It was better than you can imagine; better than food I had in L.A., TX and some places... Where do I begin with Waffle House? I would say Waffle House is excellent at 10 in the morning with your family and it is also excellent at 2 in the morning...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
