This is a 5 star rating for what the Dinner Bell is.... a traditional southern, country, family style restaurant with family style dishes served on farm... Must try! One of the best local places I have been in years. Southern food made to order! I went for a workday lunch. They were quick, friendly, and the food was good. I got the beef stew to go. At $10, and stayed under my companies weekday lunch... Ratings are a relative thing.  In Franklinton, Mike's is 5 stars.  The BBQ would be 3 -4 stars elsewhere; the steaks are 4 - 5 stars anywhere.  The hours... Ok. This is the real deal. No packaged batter and a deep fryer here. The food is authentic South Mississippi country food. Fried chicken from a frying pan,... Spectacular menu choices with very hospitable servers!! Grilled shrimp dinner included veggies, salad, potatoes, and garlic rolls for only $15. .f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
