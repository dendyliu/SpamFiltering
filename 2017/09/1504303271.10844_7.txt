Looks like a dump, it's in the middle nowhere, and the service is fairly slow.  The salad bar is what you would find in a Golden Corral.  The crab soup was... One of best crab cakes ever I've tried. ..Full of crabs no stuffing! ..Don't forget to get homemade rice pudding. They are amazing! The owner was very kind... The best place in the area. Not fancy, come as you are and just enjoy. Anything Crab, and single fry oysters. If you want ridiculously amazing food and service, go to the Ruddy Duck Brewery and Grill! Like us, you will be back again, and again, and...yeah, it's... Had a great time here for a solo dinner while in town on business. The atmosphere is warm and inviting with friendly staff. My server was great and gave... Yelp needs to update the dot locatiof8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
